# SCA
The SCA is an alternate timeline to the National Basketball Association.
When I was eight years old, I became fascinated with basketball and legends-- most notably, Kobe Bryant, Dwyane Wade, and Lebron James. Because I was an advanced elementary school student, I found myself with a lot of free time to use my imagination.
With this free time, I began writing down as many NBA teams that I could think of and pitting them against each other in my mind. 
Whenever I got home, I would spend hours upon hours recreating these matchups between great late 2000s era teams like the Celtics, Spurs, Lakers, Cavaliers, Suns, Heat, etc. Over time, it became worth keeping track of the many iterations of Finals matchups and championships between notable teams.
Once I started keeping track, it started to become unrealistic seeing Lebron and Kobe face each other in the NBA Finals for the seventh straight year in a row, so the next step of keeping the timeline going was creating new players.
Years later, the SCA had evolved to a massive collection of new expansion teams, players, player dynamics, and most importantly, special moments from the 50-year history of the SCA.
The next step in the evolution of the SCA was to see it with my own eyes. With the help of my long-time friend, Matthew Maya, I created every active SCA player in NBA 2K17, imported them to their own respective teams, and letting the CPUs run against each other in an 82-game season.
It became much easier to expedite the timeline. After another 150 years of SCA, I had a reserve of phenomenal memories about storylines, player dynamics, legends, glory, and failure.
This repository is dedicated to the data collected from every legendary player from the history of the SCA.
